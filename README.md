# Simple Storage Smart Contract

This project is a basic example of a Solidity smart contract designed to help beginners understand how to store and modify data on the Ethereum blockchain. It introduces core concepts like state variables and public functions.

## Description

The smart contract performs the following functions:

- Stores an integer value privately.
- Allows users to read the current value.
- Provides a function to increment the value by 1.
- Provides a function to decrement the value by 1.

This contract is a simple way to understand:
- Data storage in blockchain
- Function creation and access
- Basic state modification

## How to Use

### Using Remix IDE:
1. Open [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Create a new file and paste the Solidity code.
3. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler (version 0.8.0 or above).
4. Deploy the contract using the JavaScript VM.
5. Interact with the deployed contract:
   - Use `getValue()` to read the stored value.
   - Use `increment()` to add 1.
   - Use `decrement()` to subtract 1.

### Using Hardhat or Truffle (Advanced):
- Set up a local blockchain environment.
- Compile and deploy the contract.
- Interact with it via scripts or a front-end.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand smart contract state management.
- Learn how to read from and write to the blockchain.
- Practice working with public and private variables.
- Get hands-on experience with Solidity functions.
